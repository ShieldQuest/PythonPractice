# PythonPractice

A beginner-friendly Python project with step-by-step lessons covering core programming concepts like printing, 
math operations, variables, data types, conditionals, loops, and lists. The project also includes an interactive 
story game where the player meets a dragon named Bael, chooses a weapon, and prepares for an epic adventureâ€”all while 
learning how Python works. Great for absolute beginners who want to learn by doing.

If you want to run any of the files, just make sure Python 3 is installed and run them from a terminal using:

```bash
python3 filename.py
