# PythonPractice

This is my personal space to learn Python.

I’m starting with the basics and slowly building up as I go. 
You’ll find simple practice files here.
I’ll keep adding more as I learn new things.

If you want to run any of the files, just make sure Python 3 is installed and run them from a terminal using:

```bash
python3 filename.py
